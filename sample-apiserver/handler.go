// APIServerHandlers holds the different http.Handlers used by the API server.
// This includes the full handler chain, the director (which chooses between gorestful and nonGoRestful,
// the gorestful handler (used for the API) which falls through to the nonGoRestful handler on unregistered paths,
// and the nonGoRestful handler (which can contain a fallthrough of its own)
// FullHandlerChain -> Director -> {GoRestfulContainer,NonGoRestfulMux} based on inspection of registered web services
type APIServerHandler struct {
	// FullHandlerChain is the one that is eventually served with.  It should include the full filter
	// chain and then call the Director.
	FullHandlerChain http.Handler
	// The registered APIs.  InstallAPIs uses this.  Other servers probably shouldn't access this directly.
	GoRestfulContainer *restful.Container
	// NonGoRestfulMux is the final HTTP handler in the chain.
	// It comes after all filters and the API handling
	// This is where other servers can attach handler to various parts of the chain.
	NonGoRestfulMux *PathHandler

	// Director is here so that we can properly handle fall through and proxy cases.
	// This looks a bit bonkers, but here's what's happening.  We need to have /apis handling registered in gorestful in order to have
	// swagger generated for compatibility.  Doing that with `/apis` as a webservice, means that it forcibly 404s (no defaulting allowed)
	// all requests which are not /apis or /apis/.  We need those calls to fall through behind goresful for proper delegation.  Trying to
	// register for a pattern which includes everything behind it doesn't work because gorestful negotiates for verbs and content encoding
	// and all those things go crazy when gorestful really just needs to pass through.  In addition, openapi enforces unique verb constraints
	// which we don't fit into and it still muddies up swagger.  Trying to switch the webservices into a route doesn't work because the
	//  containing webservice faces all the same problems listed above.
	// This leads to the crazy thing done here.  Our mux does what we need, so we'll place it in front of gorestful.  It will introspect to
	// decide if the route is likely to be handled by goresful and route there if needed.  Otherwise, it goes to NonGoRestfulMux mux in
	// order to handle "normal" paths and delegation. Hopefully no API consumers will ever have to deal with this level of detail.  I think
	// we should consider completely removing gorestful.
	// Other servers should only use this opaquely to delegate to an API server.
