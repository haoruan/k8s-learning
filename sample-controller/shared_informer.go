	// any interactions with the authoritative storage.  Some
	// informers do no resyncs at all, not even for handlers added
	// with a non-zero resyncPeriod.  For an informer that does

	// informer develops a nominal resync period that is no shorter
	// than the requested period but may be longer.  The actual time
	// between any two resyncs may be longer than the nominal period
	// because the implementation takes time to do work and there may
